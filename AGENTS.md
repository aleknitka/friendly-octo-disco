# AGENTS Instructions

## Coding Guidelines
- Utilize object-oriented programming principles in new Python code.
- Document all public modules, classes, and functions using Google-style docstrings.
- Employ type hints throughout the codebase and run type checking with tools such as `mypy` where possible.
- Use `pydantic` models for parsing and validation of external data.

## Testing
- Write tests for new functionality using `pytest`.
- Run `pytest` before committing changes.
